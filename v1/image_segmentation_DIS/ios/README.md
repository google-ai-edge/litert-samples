# LiteRT Image Segmentation with DIS Model Demo

### Overview

This is an app that allows you to take a picture or open an image from the gallery in order to segment out the main objects within the image. 

This sample should be run on a physical iOS device.

This sample requires a model converted from PyTorch to the LiteRT format. This has been tested through [this online sample]([url](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/models-samples/blob/main/convert_pytorch/DIS_segmentation_and_quantization.ipynb)).
